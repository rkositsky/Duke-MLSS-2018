    "\n",
    "`The goal of the RL agent is to maximize the total reward it can receive throughout its lifetime. It may find certain solutions first, but these may be local optima--i.e. there may be better solutions out there. However, searching (exploring) for better solutions will necessitate trying out many bad trajectories, which decreases the agents total reward in the short term. Too much exploration, on the other hand, might mean the agent wastes actions on moves it believes have lower payoff.\n",

    "2\\. Another fundamental reinforcement learning challenge is what is known as the *credit assignment problem*, especially when rewards are sparse. \n",

    "`If rewards are sparse or don't come until the end of an episode (e.g. winning or losing a game), then the agent will have had to navigate many states and actions before receiving any feedback. In such a situation, it is hard to tell which decisions led to final good (or bad) result. This makes learning difficult, as we can't properly assign credit for the reward to each decision.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`For example, a chess bot can play like a grandmaster, but then make a single boneheaded move that leads to it being checkmated. Despite all the good moves it made before the checkmate, the entire trajectory is now credited with a loss.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`However, designing a good reward function that provides good feedback frequently is often difficult or impossible, as it may interfere with the reward function capturing the true objective. As such, we often have to make a trade-off between the credit assignment problem and having an accurate reward function.`  "

    "When Q-learning calculates the estimated future reward, it must \"guess\" the future, starting with the next action the agent will take. In Q-learning, we assume the agent will take the best possible action: $\\max_a Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a)$. SARSA, on the other hand, uses the action that was actually taken next in the episode we are learning from: $Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})$. In other words, SARSA learns from the next action he actually took (on policy), as opposed to what the max possible Q value for the next state was (off policy).\n",
