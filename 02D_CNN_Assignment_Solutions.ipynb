    "Build a 2-layer CNN for MNIST digit classfication. Feel free to play around with the model architecture and see how the training time/performance changes, but to begin, try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Image -> convolution (32 5x5 filters) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) ->  (2x2 max pool) -> convolution (64 5x5 filters) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> (2x2 max pool) -> fully connected (256 hidden units) -> nonlinearity (ReLU) -> fully connected (10 hidden units) -> softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips:\n",
    "- The CNN model might take a while to train. Depending on your machine, you might expect this to take up to half an hour. If you see your validation performance start to plateau, you can kill the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since CNNs a more complex than the logistic regression and MLP models you've worked with before, so you may find it helpful to use a more advanced optimizer. You're model will train faster if you use [`tf.train.AdamOptimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/AdamOptimizer) instead of `tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer`. A learning rate of 1e-4 is a good starting point."
